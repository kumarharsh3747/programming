Polymorphism in C++ is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects to be treated as instances of their base type while exhibiting different behaviors based on their derived type. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying data types, leading to code reusability and flexibility.

Types of Polymorphism
1.-Compile-Time Polymorphism:

Achieved through function overloading and operator overloading.
Behavior is determined at compile-time.

2.-Runtime Polymorphism:

Achieved through inheritance and virtual functions.
Behavior is determined at runtime using dynamic dispatch.

Key Points
Compile-Time Polymorphism uses static binding; Runtime Polymorphism uses dynamic binding.
Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism.
Abstract classes are created using pure virtual functions.
