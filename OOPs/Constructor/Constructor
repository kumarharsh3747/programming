Types of Constructors in C++
Constructors can be classified based on in which situations they are being used. There are 4 types of constructors in C++:

Default Constructor: No parameters. They are used to create an object with default values.

Parameterized Constructor: Takes parameters. Used to create an object with specific initial values.

Copy Constructor: Takes a reference to another object of the same class. Used to create a copy of an object.

Move Constructor: Takes an rvalue reference to another object. Transfers resources from a temporary object.
