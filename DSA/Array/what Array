an array is a data structure that is used to store multiple values of similar data types
 in a contiguous memory location.

 Properties of Arrays in C++

**An Array is a collection of data of the same data type,
 stored at a contiguous memory location.

Indexing of an array starts from 0. It means the first element is stored
 at the 0th index, the second at 1st, and so on.

Elements of an array can be accessed using their indices.

Once an array is declared its size remains constant throughout the program.
An array can have multiple dimensions.

The size of the array in bytes can be determined by the sizeof operator using which
 we can also find the number of elements in the array.

We can find the size of the type of elements stored in an array by subtracting
 adjacent addresses.
